# Favorite Tracks

Please find the project requirements here: 
https://github.com/Learnfield-GmbH/CodingChallenge/tree/master/shared/simple%20audio%20player

## Introduction

The repo is created using [expo](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). 
This project is a small one but I tried to make a structure of a larger project which we need in the real world. Some of tools used in the repo are:

- **Styled components** 
	- *One of the best ways to define styles in a react app*
- **Themes** 
	- *We don't have multiple themes and even several colors in a theme but this is the best way to use any color in the app. so it is setup)*
- **Axios** for http calls
- **React Query**
	- *For the only GET request in the app we didn't necessarily need react-query. But I have set it up as what I do in a real world project. It's a useful tool to make http calls more efficiently.*
- **Redux** for state management
- **React Navigation** for navigation

And some developer tools like ESLint and Jest.

## Run

- Make sure you have setup Expo requirements

`git clone https://github.com/poormohammadi/favorite-tracks`
